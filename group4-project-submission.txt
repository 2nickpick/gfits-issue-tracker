Our Final Group Project is an Issue Tracking System, named GFITS, which allows businesses and customers to communicate
about issues effectively.

This project is responsive, and is user-friendly on small screens.

A user manual is provided with this project at user-f.docx.

An ERD diagram is available at the end of the user manual.
